## Essential Checks

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All controls keyboard reachable; composite widgets use the established Tab/arrow-key pattern
- [ ] Focus order follows visual/logical order
- [ ] Focus is visible (outline/ring on focused elements)
- [ ] Custom widgets have keyboard support (Enter to activate, Escape to close)
- [ ] No keyboard traps (user can always Tab away from a component)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link at top of page - visible (at least) on keyboard focus
- [ ] Modals trap focus while open, return focus on close

### Screen Readers
- [ ] All images have `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative images)
- [ ] All form inputs have associated labels (`<label>` or `aria-label`)
- [ ] Buttons and links have descriptive text (not "Click here")
- [ ] Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- [ ] Page has one `<h1>` and headings don't skip levels
- [ ] Important status changes announced appropriately, without announcing every update
- [ ] Tables have `<th>` headers with scope

### Visual
- [ ] Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text) or ≥ 3:1 (large text: at least 18pt regular or 14pt bold; not 18px regular)
- [ ] UI components contrast ≥ 3:1 against background
- [ ] Color is not the only way to convey information
- [ ] Text resizable to 200% without breaking layout
- [ ] No content that flashes more than 3 times per second

### Forms
- [ ] Every input has a visible label
- [ ] Required fields indicated (not by color alone)
- [ ] Error messages specific and associated with the field
- [ ] Error state visible by more than color (icon, text, border)
- [ ] Form submission errors summarized and focusable
- [ ] Known fields use autocomplete (for example `type="email" autocomplete="email"`)

### Content
- [ ] Language declared (`<html lang="en">`)
- [ ] Page has a descriptive `<title>`
- [ ] Links distinguish from surrounding text (not by color alone)
- [ ] Prefer touch targets ≥ 44x44 CSS px on mobile; this comfort target is not the WCAG 2.1 AA minimum. When targeting WCAG 2.2 AA, verify SC 2.5.8's 24x24 CSS px or applicable spacing/other exception.
- [ ] Meaningful empty states (not blank screens)

## Common HTML Patterns

### Buttons vs. Links

```html
<!-- Use <button> for actions -->
<button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete Task</button>

<!-- Use <a> for navigation -->
<a href="/tasks/123">View Task</a>

<!-- NEVER use div/span as buttons -->
<div onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</div>  <!-- BAD -->
```

### Form Labels

```html
<!-- Explicit label association -->
<label htmlFor="email">Email address</label>
<input id="email" type="email" required />

<!-- Implicit wrapping -->
<label>
  Email address
  <input type="email" required />
</label>

<!-- Hidden label (visible label preferred) -->
<input type="search" aria-label="Search tasks" />
```

### ARIA Roles

```html
<!-- Navigation -->
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
<nav aria-label="Footer links">...</nav>

<!-- Status messages -->
<div role="status" aria-live="polite">Task saved</div>

<!-- Alert messages -->
<div role="alert">Error: Title is required</div>

<!-- Modal dialog markup; open with showModal() or a proven modal primitive.
     aria-modal alone does not implement modality or focus management. -->
<dialog aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="dialog-title">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Confirm Delete</h2>
  ...
</dialog>

<!-- Loading states -->
<div aria-busy="true" aria-label="Loading tasks">
  <Spinner />
</div>
```

### Accessible Lists

```html
<ul role="list" aria-label="Tasks">
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="task-1" aria-label="Complete: Buy groceries" />
    <label htmlFor="task-1">Buy groceries</label>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Testing Tools

These checks are not a complete conformance audit. Verify against the project's target standard. Canonical details: [text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html), [target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html), and [native modal behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal).

```bash
# Automated CLI audit against a running page
npx pa11y http://localhost:3000
```

For axe-based checks, use the project's existing integration such as `@axe-core/playwright` or `jest-axe`; the `axe-core` package itself does not expose an `npx axe-core` CLI.

## Quick Reference: ARIA Live Regions

| Value | Behavior | Use For |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `aria-live="polite"` | Announced at next pause | Status updates, saved confirmations |
| `aria-live="assertive"` | Announced immediately | Errors, time-sensitive alerts |
| `role="status"` | Same as `polite` | Status messages |
| `role="alert"` | Same as `assertive` | Error messages |

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `div` as button | Not focusable, no keyboard support | Use `<button>` |
| Missing `alt` text | Images invisible to screen readers | Add descriptive `alt` |
| Color-only states | Invisible to color-blind users | Add icons, text, or patterns |
| Autoplaying media | Disorienting, can't be stopped | Add controls, don't autoplay |
| Custom dropdown with no ARIA | Unusable by keyboard/screen reader | Use native `<select>` or proper ARIA listbox |
| Removing focus outlines | Users can't see where they are | Style outlines, don't remove them |
| Empty links/buttons | "Link" announced with no description | Add text or `aria-label` |
| `tabindex > 0` | Breaks natural tab order | Use `tabindex="0"` or `-1` only |
